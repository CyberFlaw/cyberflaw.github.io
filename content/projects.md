I've started my Developer journey around my *fresher year* of my *bachelor's degree*. Over the years I've played in a wide variety of areas. These include *Full Stack Web Development*, *Mobile Development*, *Computer Graphics*, *Cloud Computing*, *DevOps*, and so on. Some of the documented side projects I've done are listed below

+ *Chat Application* : Build on Next.Js as Frontend and Rust (Actix Web) as Backend

+ *IEEE SB GECT Club Website* : Build on Gatsby.Js

+ *OpenGL Rendering Engine* : Build using C++

+ *Backend for Covid Tracker* : Build using Node.js

+ *Pointing Device* : Build on ESP32 NodeMCU

+ *Blood Bank Website* : Build on MERN Stack

+ *Custom Network Protocol over TCP* : Building using Rust (Current Project)

+ *Web Scraper Bots* : Build using Python

I'm also exploring Linux and it's architecture now. Some day I wish to contribute to the Linux kernel
