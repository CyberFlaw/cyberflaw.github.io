I've started my Developer journey around my *fresher year* of my *bachelor's degree*. Over the years I've played in a wide variety of areas. These include *Full Stack Web Development*, *Mobile Development*, *Computer Graphics*, *Cloud Computing*, *DevOps*, and so on. Some of the documented side projects I've done are listed below

+ [*Chat Application*](/project/rumble) : Build on Next.Js as Frontend and Rust (Actix Web) as Backend

+ [*IEEE SB GECT Club Website*](/project/ieee-website) : Build on Gatsby.Js

+ [*OpenGL Rendering Engine*](/project/rendering-engine) : Build using C++

+ [*Backend for Covid Tracker*](/project/covid-focus) : Build using Node.js

I'm also exploring Linux and it's architecture now. Some day I wish to contribute to the Linux kernel
