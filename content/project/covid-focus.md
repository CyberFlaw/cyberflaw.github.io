### History

This project was handed over to us by one of our professors. We were asked to create a Covid tracker for a Panchayat. We used *React.js* to build the front end, which I didn't involve too much. I was handling the backend and database for the project. I used *Node.js* for creating the *REST API* and *Postgresql* as the database for the tracker

### Why Node.js and Postgresql

I used **Node.js* as I'm most familiar with that during that era. I gathered a lot of knowledge by watching and doing various side projects and hackathons at that time. I wanted to use all those knowledge and make a production-ready application

Postgresql is used because the data from the tracker is highly structured. So it's always a good idea to use a relational database, and so I did. I chose Postgresql over Mysql for the advanced querying Postgress provides

### Current State

The application is currently down as the panchayat don't need it anymore
