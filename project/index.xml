      <description>History Link to heading This project was handed over to us by one of our professors. We were asked to create a Covid tracker for a Panchayat. We used React.js to build the front end, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t involve too much. I was handling the backend and database for the project. I used Node.js for creating the REST API and Postgresql as the database for the tracker
Why Node.js and Postgresql Link to heading I used *Node.</description>

      <description>History Link to heading It would be a lie if I say that I was never into game development, even my first ever programming-ish experience was making a Game in Game Maker Engine way back. When I was randomly scrolling through Youtube one day, if I remember correctly it was during the launch of PS5 and the Unreal Engine Demo, a dude named The Cherno popped up on my feed.</description>
